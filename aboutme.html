        <h2>Hi! My name is Lorenzo Lammertink.</h2>
    </article>
    <article class="boutme1">
        <p>I have a passion for music and technology. I have always played in bands or recorded my own music at home. Right now, I play drums in Durden.
            <br><br> At this time, I’m studying Software Development at ROC Mondriaan in the Hague. I’m a first year without any prior coding experience, but it sure is fun to learn!
            <br><br> I’ve always been passionate about work. If I commit my day to being there, I’m there for one hundred percent and giving it my all. Prior to kicking off this study, I worked in logistics and studied to become a team leader. It sure was fun, but being a team leader on the spot in a dusty warehouse wasn’t where I could see myself in the following ten years.
            <br><br> I felt this wasn’t the end of the line for me and I wanted to work in a sector where I could love my job. Of course, being into video games and computers in general (and always being a troubleshooter for everything and everyone) has led me to the point where I want to learn to code.
            <br><br> While I studied logistics, I got offered another position as team leader at the inbound department. Beforehand, I was mainly packaging products for the online department.<br><br> Moving to this new position was a huge challenge. The inbound department had many employees and we had to flexibly interchange our personnel (and also our leading staff) so we could go home in time.<br><br> Working +- 70 hours every week around Christmas time, leaving the workplace tidy, and making sure no mistakes were made in the process sure was tough, but I can proudly say that is my biggest professional accomplishment.

            With Warborn Waste, we’ve played a huge number of shows. We played support acts for bands I couldn’t believe we’d play with at festivals with maybe even thousands of visitors. That’s a time I’d really like to revisit with my current band, and I’d like to say this is my biggest personal accomplishment. Playing shows and making music has always made me feel content.
